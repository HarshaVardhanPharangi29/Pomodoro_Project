## üß† The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a "pomodoro" (Italian for tomato) after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

- **State Management**: Uses React's useState hook for managing application state
- **Side Effects**: Implements useEffect for timer functionality and local storage persistence
- **Audio Integration**: Uses the Web Audio API for session completion sounds
- **SVG Animation**: Dynamic SVG properties for visual timer representation

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- Task management integration
- Statistics and analytics dashboard
- User accounts for cross-device synchronization
- Additional themes and customization options
- Progressive Web App (PWA) implementation
